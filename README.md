# Face-Recognition

---

<h2>What is Face-Recognition ?</h2>
Face recognition is a biometric technology that recognizes or authenticates an individual by scanning facial features through image processing and machine learning algorithms. The system identifies a face, extracts important features, digitizes them into numerical information, and compares it with stored profiles for authentication or identification. To assess the performance of a face recognition system, measures such as accuracy (overall correctness), precision (correct positive predictions), recall (ability to locate all actual positives), and F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) are utilized to quantify its reliability and efficency.
